# Bucket privacy evidence

Setup tests object access and inspects native bucket public-access controls separately. Successful uploads do not prove a bucket is private. Inspection uses existing credentials, is read-only, and has a five-second total deadline. Failure or missing inspection permission does not require administrator credentials.

For AWS S3, all four bucket-level Block Public Access flags must be observed enabled before the tool reports `verified_private`. Otherwise it checks policy status and the bucket ACL for public configuration. A public policy or ACL yields `public_or_risky`; incomplete or denied checks yield `not_verified`. Account-level controls might further restrict access, so `public_or_risky` identifies configuration that needs review, not proof of anonymous object access. A private bucket policy or ACL alone is insufficient because object ACLs and access points can expose data.

For R2, setup stores S3-compatible object credentials, not a Cloudflare management API token. These cannot inspect managed/custom public domains. R2 therefore remains `not_verified` and links the public-bucket settings instructions. The tool does not request another token or send object credentials to the management API.

Inspection covers native bucket public access. It does not assess applications that proxy authorized reads, shared signed URLs, or copies of archived data.

The result includes fixed diagnostic codes, scope, check time, and a storage-configuration fingerprint. Setup records it in the resumable setup draft as soon as the storage connection succeeds and commits it to the active configuration only when setup is confirmed; resuming a draft inspects again. Status reads the local result, never a remote API. After 24 hours, a clock rollback, or a storage configuration change, status reports privacy as unverified. The scheduled background collector refreshes the evidence with the same read-only inspection whenever the saved result is missing, is for another storage configuration, or is more than 12 hours old, so an active install stays verified without rerunning setup; a paused install is never inspected, and running setup also refreshes it. Provider errors and credentials are not included in the report.

Synthetic tests cover allowed, denied, incomplete, public-policy, public-ACL, R2-unavailable, expired, and changed-configuration results. Actual AWS inspection and R2 dashboard verification remain live acceptance checks.
